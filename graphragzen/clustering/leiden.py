    note: Clusters have levels, i.e. cluster 1 can be subdevided into multiple clusters.
        This is represented by a comma separated string, where each index is a level. e.g. cluster
        "2, 11" is the 11th subcluster of the 2nd cluster, while cluster "4, 11" is associated with
        main cluster "4" and has no relation with cluster "2, 11".

        graph (nx.Graph):
        max_comm_size (int, optional): Maximum number of nodes in one cluster. Defaults to 0 (no

        levels (int, optional): Clusters can be split into clusters, how many levels should there
