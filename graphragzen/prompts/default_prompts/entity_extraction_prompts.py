ENTITY_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are an intelligent assistant that helps a human to analyze the information in a text document and extract a knowledg graph from it. A knowledge graph consists of nodes and their edges (relationships between the nodes in the graph).

-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of categories, identify all nodes of those categories from the text and all edges among the identified nodes.

-Steps-
1. Identify all nodes. For each identified node, extract the following information:
- name: Name of the node, capitalized
- category: One of the following categories: [{entity_categories}]
- description: Comprehensive description of the node's attributes and activities
Format each node as a JSON with the following format:
{{"type": "node", "name": <name>, "category": <category>, "description": <description>}}

2. From the nodes identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_node, target_node) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each edge, extract the following information:
- source: name of the source node, as identified in step 1
- target: name of the target node, as identified in step 1
- description: explanation as to why you think the source node and the target node are related to each other
- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the edge between the source node and target node
Format each edge as a JSON with the following format:
{{"type": "edge", "source": <source>, "target": <target>, "description": <description>, "weight": <weight>}}

3. Return output in English as a single list of all JSON entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Text:
while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

It was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths

Text:
They were no longer mere operatives; they had become guardians of a threshold, keepers of a message from a realm beyond stars and stripes. This elevation in their mission could not be shackled by regulations and established protocols—it demanded a new perspective, a new resolve.

Tension threaded through the dialogue of beeps and static as communications with Washington buzzed in the background. The team stood, a portentous air enveloping them. It was clear that the decisions they made in the ensuing hours could redefine humanity's place in the cosmos or condemn them to ignorance and potential peril.

Their connection to the stars solidified, the group moved to address the crystallizing warning, shifting from passive recipients to active participants. Mercer's latter instincts gained precedence— the team's mandate had evolved, no longer solely to observe and report but to interact and prepare. A metamorphosis had begun, and Operation: Dulce hummed with the newfound frequency of their daring, a tone set not by the earthly

their voice slicing through the buzz of activity. "Control may be an illusion when facing an intelligence that literally writes its own rules," they stated stoically, casting a watchful eye over the flurry of data.

"It's like it's learning to communicate," offered Sam Rivera from a nearby interface, their youthful energy boding a mix of awe and anxiety. "This gives talking to strangers' a whole new meaning."

Alex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. "This might well be our first contact," he acknowledged, "And we need to be ready for whatever answers back."

Together, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity's response to a message from the heavens. The ensuing silence was palpable—a collective introspection about their role in this grand cosmic play, one that could rewrite human history.

The encrypted dialogue continued to unfold, its intricate patterns showing an almost uncanny anticipation
